## Sprint 015 - Billing, Plans & Subscriptions + Functionality Audit — 2026-07-07

Added:

- **Billing, Plans & Subscriptions** — code-authoritative plans catalog
  (Starter / Growth / Scale), per-organization subscription state (migration
  `0014_billing.sql`: `billing_subscriptions`, `billing_customers`,
  `billing_events`), a `BillingProvider` adapter with real Stripe + simulated
  providers (simulated by default when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is absent),
  server-side entitlement enforcement (employees / knowledge / connections /
  interaction quota), the billing dashboard (`/dashboard/settings/billing` and
  `/plans`), and the Stripe webhook (`/api/webhooks/billing/stripe`). Every new
  organization starts on Starter automatically; `billing.view` for all roles,
  `billing.manage` for owner/admin.
- **Functionality audit & repair** — a route-by-route audit
  (`05_reports/FUNCTIONALITY_AUDIT.md`) plus six repair batches: audit trail,
  onboarding polish, employee usage/activity, error surfacing, voice credential
  parity, and real webhook signature verification (SendGrid / Telnyx / Vonage);
  and a real Connections "Test" action.
- **Reports** — `05_reports/FUNCTIONALITY_AUDIT.md` and
  `05_reports/RUNTIME_VERIFICATION.md`.

Numbering: the billing sprint is **Sprint 015** (it follows 014 Connections). The
migration file keeps its independent number `0014_billing.sql`.
